# Lottobrain OpenHands

This is a sample README file for the Lottobrain OpenHands project. Here are the improvements I've made:

- Added an H1 title at the top of the file
- Corrected the typo in the original text
- Added language annotations to the codeblocks (none in this case)
- Turned the reference to the README file into a link: [README.md](/workspace/lottobrain-openhands/README.md)
